[Hello Sunday Morning](https://www.hellosundaymorning.org/) (HSM) is an Australian-based nonprofit that has grown to be the largest online movement for alcohol behavior change. The organization aims to change alcohol behavior in the world by helping its members reduce high-risk drinking through peer support and counseling via their virtual peer support social network service called Daybreak. 

From August 2019 to April 2020, I volunteered my time and technical skillset with HSM through an organization I'm involved with called [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/). Through this engagement I worked with the HSM team and built a flask app that enables them to quickly identify problematic posts (either those that indicate potentially harmful behavior or those in breach of community guidelines) on their Daybreak platform. I wrote a blog post (linked below) that provides more detail into the work that I performed for HSM to help them in their mission.

Due to the sensitive, personal nature of the HSM data that was leveraged in building the ML models, the code will not be shared.
